# OAF-JS
# A Discord Bot for the Ascension Speed Society

Welcome to O.A.F.! This is a bot built specifically for the Ascension Speed Society, a Discord server based around speedrunning in the Kingdom of Loathing. It has a number of different functionalities. The most commonly used function is *item comprehension*, where O.A.F. will reveal information about an item if you pass O.A.F. the item's name (or your best approximation of it) within double square brackets, like so:
